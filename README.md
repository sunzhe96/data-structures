# Data Structures

This repository contains my implementations of the data structures taught in a Data Structures Course of Coursera. The implementation is in the Go programming language.

## Below is the list of data structures I am working on.

- [] Linked Lists
- [] Stacks
- [] Quenes
- [] Trees
- [] Priority Quenes
- [] Disjoint Sets
- [] Binary Search Trees
- [] AVL Trees
- [] Splay Trees

## Linked lists API

| API                  | function                     |
|----------------------+------------------------------|
| pushFront(Key)       | add key to front             |
|                      |                              |
| topFront()           | return key of the front item |
|                      |                              |
| popFront()           | remove the front item        |
|                      |                              |
| pushBack()           | add item to back             |
|                      |                              |
| topBack()            | return key of back item      |
|                      |                              |
| popback()            | remove back item             |
|                      |                              |
| find(Key)            | is key in list?              |
|                      |                              |
| erase(Key)           | remove key from list         |
|                      |                              |
| empty()              | is list empty?               |
